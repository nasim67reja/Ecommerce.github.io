### What I learned

I have learned a lot of cool technique by building this project such don't use **display:none** property beacuse **display:none** doesn't support transition property.

I have learned event delegation and by the help of this I was able to done the tab component . I also learn how to create a slider.

I have learned how to use box shadow instead of border-bottom

```css
.main-nav-link:hover,
.main-nav-link:active {
  /* trick */
  box-shadow: 0px 6.1rem 0 -8px var(--main-color);
}
```

```js
tabBox.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  const clicked = e.target.closest(".product-image-small");
  if (!clicked) return;

  //   remove active class
  tabImage.forEach((el) => el.classList.remove("active-small"));
  contentImage.forEach((el) => el.classList.remove("active"));

  //add active class
  clicked.classList.add("active-small");
  document
    .querySelector(`.operation-content-${clicked.dataset.tab}`)
    .classList.add("active");
});
```

### Continued development

I want to continue building project but these time i want to focus on javascript more than html and css.

### Useful resources
